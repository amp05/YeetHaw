Instructions:

To start, click anywhere in the main menu
When prompted GO, input arrowkeys in the order displayed. If you take too long you lose a life. If you input an arrowkey before being prompted, it'll count as a false start and take a life. The game is infinite, and the number of inputs increase as you go along (time adjusts accordingly)
